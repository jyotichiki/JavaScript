/*if we want to declare variable its two type 
1.let
2.var
In JavaScript, we can declare variables using either let or var. We avoid using var because it doesn't handle scope well,
meaning it can cause problems in certain parts of the code, like inside loops or if statements.
Instead, we use let because it properly limits the variable to the block of code where itâ€™s defined, 
making things easier to manage and less prone to errors.*/
